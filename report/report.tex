\section{Problem Contextualization}

This report was written for the course of 'Advanced Algorithms', taught by 
professor Joaquim Madeira for the master's in Informatics Engineering at DETI UA.
It describes the work done for the third assignment of the course \cite{trab3}.
The chosen hypothesis was "Hipótese A-2 – Contagem dos Itens Mais Frequentes".
